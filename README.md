# Concurrent Traffic Simulation

This project practices C++ concurrency.

I found this [resource](https://medium.com/codex/c-multithreading-the-simple-way-95aa1f7304a2) I really liked which introduced multithreading and concurrency, especially because this line -
>Multithreading often carries a reputation for being difficult. Compared with other concepts in software development, one could certainly make a case for that. However, multithreading isn’t really that different from general programming. It’s just potentially more dangerous . Learning to protect against the danger, though, can allow one to implement far more powerful algorithms and programs than you could in a single threaded manner."

Or, more or less, the data races are not 100% guaranteed to show up per run. You should be able to spot them on your own.

I was very interested in the fact that, because threads do not have a copy constructor, a vector of threads needs to be populated by the move constructor and therefore by using `emplace_back`; also, when multiple threads are running, interleaved work can present a bug such as interrupted print statements in `cout`- `cout` is a shared resource that can be accessed in the middle of executing another method (??).

Notable code changes made in the project:
- The basic structure of the project was already implemented- vehicles heading to destinations, communicating with an open intersection, and passing through one at a time worked. What was implemented was the ability for a traffic light to have a red light, and therefore pause the flow of cars. In addition to FIFO of cars being let through, the lights cycle between red and green. 
- Flesh out a generic message queue with implementation split across `TrafficLight.h` and `TrafficLight.cpp`. Add some connecting code in `Intersection`, with a notable lines being `L87` to `L91`.
- This wasn't in the project spec at all, but I wanted to pass in a parameter to the driver that would allow CLI toggling
between the two cities Paris and NYC. The data and functions are already pre-written within the driver, all that has to be changed
are which method is called in the `main` function. This is still unimplemented.

## Basic Build Instructions

Two Options - 
1. Only download the executable `traffic_simulation` from the `build` folder, and run it 
through the `./traffic_simulation` command in the same directory.
Or-
1. Clone repo to local.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it through the following command: `./traffic_simulation`.
